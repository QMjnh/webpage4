I got the chance to learn about Maths & Statistics, combine with what I've known in Artificial Intelligence, implemented in practice to form Data Science

### Projects
* ***Flower Classifier [Interactive Model](https://huggingface.co/spaces/qmjnh/flowerClassification_2)***
This is the Capstone Project for ML4AI. This is a Machine Learning model built (using the oxford-102-flowers dataset) to classify the flower from any given input image. Read more about the model in this [Github repo](https://github.com/QMjnh/ML4AI_CAPSTONE_FlowersClassification) or watch modelâ€™s presentation (in Vietnamese) [here](https://youtu.be/xVstwl1LjRM).

* ***Modified Chrome Dino [game](https://qmjnh.github.io/dinogame/)***
The original Chromium Dino game was modified in animations and interface to become a slightly different game. It looks simple but the modification in animation was especially tricky and requires understanding of sprite-sheet animation, game mechanics, HTML and CSS to create a 3-frame-animation from the original 2-frame-animation.

* ***Website [demo](https://qmjnh.github.io/CL1_20-23/)***
It is just a website demo that I made for fun, to apply what I learned in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript

### Experience
* ***Teaching Assistant*** in PythonAI course at LHP-CoTAI 2022 AI program

My job's title is to self-explanatory. I help students and answers their questions both in class and after class to make sure they're confident with the material. I also occasionally do online tutor sessions to help the students get a better grasp of the previous sessions or to revise before the exams. I also do backstage work like grading homework or preparing the room for class.
